Most common recommendations are Nikwax or Grangers, but Nikwax is mentioned a lot more, so I use that.

Nikwax don't sell footwear washing stuff, so I use Grangers for that.

# When to wash
- Whenever necessary (TX Direct withstands 4-6 washes with Tech Wash)

# When to re-waterproof
- At the end of the season, if applicable
- Around every 6-12 months

# Re-waterproofing
## If already clean
- Put the dry garment in the dryer for 20 minutes at a low temperature (60°C) or one dot (heating process)

## If washing is needed
0. If super dirty (oil, grease, etc.), use a normal detergent first. (However, you will have to wash and use a re-waterproofing agent if you do this.)
1. Clear washing machine of detergent. (Grab a bottle of water and flush through the detergent drain till empty, then run on 40 degrees wash whilst empty.)
2. Wash and waterproof 1-2 items at a time. Some sites recommend reproofing items separately for maximum effectiveness. More than 2 and they won't have enough of their surface area exposed. If you have a small washing machine, probably just do 1, so they're not squished together.
3. Do up any zips and velcro on the garments.
4. Wash with a technical washing detergent ([Nikwax Tech Wash]) using label as guideline (usually 30 degrees, sometimes 40 degrees), on a gentle wash/ low spin cycle (400 or as close to).
5. Do a rinse cycle.
6. Optional: Wash with a reproofing agent ([Nikwax TX Direct]) and do **another** rinse cycle.
7. Drain cycle on washing machine to get rid of excess water.
8. Optionally dry. (The [gore tex advice][Gore-Tex washing advice] recommends tumble drying clean gear even if not straight after washing, so maybe you can line dry then tumble dry at a later point.)
9. Heat (heat helps DWR bond, so a low tumble dry, using a hair dryer or ironing on a low setting are good options if it's not very warm out).

Some people use the spray on stuff for a touch up between big washes.

## Tumble drying
Supposedly Nikwax doesn't need heat/ to tumble dry, but then their FAQ says "Nikwax products will achieve the same, if not better standard of water-repellency than competitor products without using heat." [[FAQ - Nikwax]] Does this just mean it's better than other products if they're used without heat?

On the product website it says to "Air dry or tumble dry on a low setting if care label allows." Earlier in the page it claims "as the need for tumble drying is removed, this saves energy and protects more vulnerable, older, garments from heat." [[Nikwax TX Direct]]

I think basically they removed the requirement of tumble drying to boast a better energy rating, but it does still help.

# Down
Uses different washing and proofing agents

# Wash in vs. spray on
> By immersing a garment in a wash-in treatment you apply a complete and even coating of the active ingredients to all the fibers, zips and threads. The treatment finds its way to the back of zips and pocket flaps, behind velcro tabs – all the places that are easy to miss with spray-on treatments. You do not miss any part. Clothing that is PU coated can be coated with a Nikwax waterproofing treatment by using our TX.Direct spray-on product to the outside of the garment only. This product means you can target specific areas of the jacket that need waterproofing anytime, anywhere.
