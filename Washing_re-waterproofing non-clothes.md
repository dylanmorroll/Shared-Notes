# Tents
- Try using sponge/ brush/ warm water
- Use a tech wash/ mild detergent
- Reproof with spray on reproofing

NB: Grangers specifically mentions tents in their tech wash and reproofing products, but it's multi-purpose just like Nikwax, not tent specific.

# Bivvy Bag/ Raincoats
- Use tech wash or warm water

# Footwear
1. Remove shoelaces (these can be washed separately)
2. Brush off dirt and mud
3. Clean footwear with a footwear specific cleaning product
4. Spray reproofing directly onto a freshly-cleaned, damp footwear, applying evenly.
5. Remove any excess product with a clean cloth.
6. Allow to dry fully before use.
7. If required, apply a second coat once dry.

Also Alpkit says synthetic is easier to wash, so I presume normal tech-wash is fine.

## Down
- Use down specific wash

# Nano-Air
It has a DWR finish so I guess don't use normal detergent.

People say to use a mild detergent. Dunno what that is? Is it the same as a neutral soap?
