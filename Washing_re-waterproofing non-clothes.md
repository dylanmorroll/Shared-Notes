# Footwear
1. Remove shoelaces (these can be washed separately)
2. Brush off dirt and mud
3. Clean footwear with a footwear specific cleaning product
4. Spray reproofing directly onto a freshly-cleaned, damp footwear, applying evenly.
5. Remove any excess product with a clean cloth.
6. Allow to dry fully before use.
7. If required, apply a second coat once dry.

# Tents
- Try using sponge/ brush/ warm water
- Use a tech wash/ mild detergent
- Reproof with spray on reproofing

NB: Grangers specifically mentions tents in their tech wash and reproofing products, but it's multi-purpose just like Nikwax, not tent specific.
