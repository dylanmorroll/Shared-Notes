# Storing/ packing
>  From what I understand, (I believe this is from Jardine), it isnt so much the packing but the unpacking that can cause serious problems with synthetics. Store it loose for sure, but, when you are pulling it out of your pack, don't just grab a peice and yank. This can tear the synthetic and make it not perform as well.

## Synthetic
Synthetics generally don't re-loft as well. It's a downside of using them.

Some people say a tumble dry could help though.

## Down
